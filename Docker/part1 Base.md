# 🏗️ **PART 1 – Foundations of Docker**

---

## 🎯 **What We Are Going to Do in This Part**

This part of the book will act as the **foundation** for your Docker journey. Just like a building cannot stand strong without a solid base, you cannot master Docker without understanding its core fundamentals. Here’s what we’ll focus on:

### 🔹 **1. Understand the Basics of Containerization**
- What containers are, and how they differ from Virtual Machines.
- Why containerization is the future of software development and deployment.
- Real-world problems that Docker solves.

### 🔹 **2. Learn the Docker Ecosystem**
- The journey of Docker’s evolution and why it became the standard.
- Key concepts: Docker Images, Containers, and Registries.
- The Docker workflow from developer machine to production.

### 🔹 **3. Install and Set Up Docker**
- Step-by-step installation on Windows, Mac, and Linux.
- Verifying the installation with a simple **Hello World container**.

### 🔹 **4. Explore Docker Architecture**
- How the Docker Daemon, CLI, and API work together.
- The role of Registries (like DockerHub).
- Deep dive into **namespaces**, **cgroups**, and **storage drivers**.

### 🔹 **5. First Hands-On With Java Example**
- Run your very first Java application inside a Docker container.
- Understand how containerization makes Java deployments portable and efficient.

## 🏆 **End Goal of Part 1**
By the end of this section, you will:
- Clearly understand the **“Why” and “What” of Docker**.
- Have Docker running on your machine.
- Run your first **Java-based containerized application**.
- Be fully prepared to move into **Core Docker Concepts** in Part 2.
