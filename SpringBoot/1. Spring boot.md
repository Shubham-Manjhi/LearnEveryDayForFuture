# 🚀 Spring Boot Framework for Modern Java Applications

---

## 🎯 Introduction

Spring Boot is a **powerful framework** built on top of the **Spring Framework**, designed to simplify the process of creating production-ready applications. It provides:

- Pre-configured defaults (auto-configuration)
- Embedded servers (Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow)
- Opinionated starter dependencies
- Production-ready features (metrics, health checks, logging, security)

👉 **Key Goal:** Reduce boilerplate configuration and enable developers to focus on **business logic**.

## 📖 1. What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is an **opinionated framework** that reduces development effort by eliminating XML configuration and offering ready-to-use features.

- Provides **standalone applications**.
- Uses **convention over configuration**.
- Offers **embedded web servers** for quick deployment.
- Integrates seamlessly with **Spring Ecosystem**.

---

## 🏗️ 2. Features of Spring Boot

- **Auto-Configuration**: Automatically configures beans based on classpath.
- **Spring Boot Starters**: Predefined dependencies for quick setup.
- **Embedded Servers**: No need for external deployment.
- **Actuator**: Provides monitoring & management endpoints.
- **Production-ready**: Includes health checks, metrics, logging.
- **CLI support**: For running Spring apps quickly.

---

## ⚙️ 3. Spring Boot Architecture

Spring Boot follows a **layered architecture**:

- **Presentation Layer**: Controllers, REST APIs.
- **Business Layer**: Services with business logic.
- **Persistence Layer**: Repositories interacting with DB.
- **Database Layer**: Data sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

### Flow:

1. User makes a request → Controller.
2. Controller calls Service layer.
3. Service interacts with Repository.
4. Repository communicates with Database.

---

## 🔄 4. Spring Boot Annotations

Commonly used annotations:

- `@SpringBootApplication` → Main entry point.
- `@RestController` → REST APIs.
- `@Service` → Business logic layer.
- `@Repository` → Persistence layer.
- `@Autowired` → Dependency injection.
- `@Configuration` → Define configuration beans.
- `@Component` → Generic Spring bean.
- `@Value` → Inject values from properties.

---

## 🧩 5. Spring Boot Auto-Configuration

- Automatically configures Spring beans based on classpath and environment.
- Example:
  - If `spring-boot-starter-web` is in the classpath, Spring Boot configures **Tomcat** and **DispatcherServlet** automatically.

Disable auto-configuration:

```java
@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {DataSourceAutoConfiguration.class})
public class MyApplication {}
```

---

## 📦 6. Spring Boot Starter Dependencies

Spring Boot starters are curated dependency descriptors.

Examples:

- `spring-boot-starter-web` → RESTful APIs
- `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` → Database with Hibernate
- `spring-boot-starter-security` → Security and authentication
- `spring-boot-starter-test` → Unit testing support

👉 Reduces dependency management hassle.

---

## 🌐 7. Embedded Servers

Spring Boot supports embedded servers:

- **Tomcat** (default)
- **Jetty**
- **Undertow**

This eliminates the need to deploy WAR files. Instead, you can run applications as **executable JARs**.

```bash
java -jar myapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

## 🛠️ 8. Example of Spring Boot Application

```java
@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}

@RestController
class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot!";
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Hello, Spring Boot!
```

---

## 🧪 9. Testing in Spring Boot

Spring Boot provides `spring-boot-starter-test` for testing.

```java
@SpringBootTest
class DemoApplicationTests {

    @Autowired
    private HelloController controller;

    @Test
    void testHello() {
        assertEquals("Hello, Spring Boot!", controller.sayHello());
    }
}
```

## ⚖️ 10. Advantages of Spring Boot

- ✅ Reduces boilerplate code
- ✅ Fast development
- ✅ Production-ready features
- ✅ Embedded servers
- ✅ Easy integration with databases & cloud
- ✅ Rich testing support

## ❓ 11. Common Interview Questions on Spring Boot

1. **What is Spring Boot and how is it different from Spring Framework?**

   - Spring Boot is an opinionated framework with auto-configuration & embedded servers.

2. **What is the role of **``**?**

   - Combines `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`.

3. **Difference between Spring and Spring Boot starters?**

   - Spring needs manual dependencies; Boot provides curated starter dependencies.

4. **How does auto-configuration work?**

   - Uses `@EnableAutoConfiguration` and `spring.factories`.

5. **How do you monitor Spring Boot apps?**

   - Using Spring Boot Actuator.

6. **Difference between embedded Tomcat and external Tomcat?**

   - Embedded Tomcat runs inside the app JAR; external requires WAR deployment.

7. **How do you secure a Spring Boot application?**

   - Using `spring-boot-starter-security` and annotations like `@EnableWebSecurity`.

# 🎉 Conclusion

Spring Boot revolutionizes Java application development by providing **simplicity, productivity, and production readiness**. With its **auto-configuration, starter dependencies, embedded servers, and Actuator**, it enables developers to focus more on business functionality instead of infrastructure and configuration.
