# üåä LeetCode 200. Number of Islands

---

## ‚úÖ 1. Definition and Purpose

- Problem: Count the number of connected land components (islands) in a 2D grid of '1's (land) and '0's (water).
- Purpose: Demonstrates traversal of connected components using DFS or BFS.
- Use Case: Mapping, flood-fill algorithms, connectivity problems in graphs.

## ‚úÖ 2. Syntax and Structure

### Function Signature
```java
public int numIslands(char[][] grid)
```

### Traversal Directions
```java
int[][] directions = {{0,1},{1,0},{0,-1},{-1,0}}; // Right, Down, Left, Up
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Practical Examples

### Input Grid
```
11110
11010
11000
00000
```
Output: 1 (One connected island)

```
11000
11000
00100
00011
```
Output: 3 (Three islands)

### DFS Code
```java
public int numIslands(char[][] grid) {
    if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return 0;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                dfs(grid, i, j);
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

void dfs(char[][] grid, int i, int j) {
    if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= grid.length || j >= grid[0].length || grid[i][j] == '0') return;
    grid[i][j] = '0'; // mark as visited
    dfs(grid, i+1, j);
    dfs(grid, i-1, j);
    dfs(grid, i, j+1);
    dfs(grid, i, j-1);
}
```

## ‚úÖ 4. Internal Working

- DFS visits each cell and its neighbors recursively.
- Each time DFS is triggered, it floods the island.
- After all land is marked visited, the main loop continues.

Time Complexity: O(M √ó N)  
Space Complexity: O(M √ó N) in worst case for recursive stack

## ‚úÖ 5. ASCII Diagram

```
Input Grid:
[
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [1,1,0,0,0],
 [0,0,1,0,0],
 [0,0,0,1,1]
]

Flooding Process:
DFS(0,0) ‚ûù marks connected 1's to 0
DFS(2,2) ‚ûù another island
DFS(3,3) ‚ûù another island
```

## ‚úÖ 6. Best Practices

- Use DFS for recursion; BFS can avoid stack overflow.
- Modify grid in-place if allowed to save space.
- Otherwise, use a visited[][] boolean array.
