**System Design: Distributed Task Scheduler**

---

### ✅ 1. Clarify the Requirements

**Functional Clarifications:**
- System should schedule and execute tasks (e.g., ETL jobs, emails, report generation) at specified times or intervals.
- Allow support for both **recurring** and **one-time** tasks.
- Support **distributed worker nodes** to execute tasks.
- Allow **task prioritization** and **retry on failure**.
- Support **delayed scheduling**, **cron expressions**, and **manual triggers**.
- Maintain task metadata (status, output, logs).
- Support **webhooks** or callbacks after completion.

**Non-Functional Clarifications:**
- Must be **fault-tolerant** and **highly available**.
- Should handle **millions of concurrent tasks** across time zones.
- **Eventual consistency** in logs and reporting is acceptable.
- Must support **horizontal scalability**.
- Provide clear observability: status, latency, retries, failures.
- Secure: **access control** and audit trails.

---

### ✅ 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Task Submission**: Create new one-time or recurring tasks.
2. **Task Execution**: Pick and run the job using worker nodes.
3. **Retry Mechanism**: Re-attempt failed tasks with exponential backoff.
4. **Monitoring Interface**: Track status, errors, and execution time.
5. **Cron/Interval Parser**: Parse scheduling inputs accurately.
6. **Notification/Callback**: Notify users or systems after task success/failure.
7. **Priority Queuing**: Ensure urgent tasks execute sooner.

---

### ✅ 3. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **High Availability**: Leader election for scheduling, worker redundancy.
2. **Scalability**: Add workers to handle load; decouple scheduler from executor.
3. **Latency**: Trigger task within 1 second of scheduled time.
4. **Fault Tolerance**: Persist task state, heartbeat detection of failures.
5. **Security**: Token-based auth, encrypted payloads.
6. **Auditability**: Logs, retries, status snapshots.
7. **Extensibility**: Pluggable executor types (email, shell, Lambda, etc.)

### ✅ 5. Component Deep Dive

1. **API Gateway**: Authenticates incoming task creation requests and forwards them to the Scheduler.

2. **Scheduler**: Core component. Picks tasks from metadata based on time, cron, and pushes into Kafka.
   - Runs a distributed lock via Zookeeper/Etcd.
   - Ensures only one node picks task at a time.

3. **Queue (Kafka)**: Temporarily holds tasks to be picked by workers.
   - Topics based on priority levels.

4. **Metadata Store (SQL/NoSQL)**:
   - Stores task definitions, next run time, retry count, etc.
   - Supports updates and cancellation.

5. **Task History DB**:
   - Logs all completed, failed, and retried tasks.
   - Useful for analytics and audit.

6. **Worker Nodes**:
   - Poll Kafka, pick up task, and execute.
   - Stateless, scalable.
   - Handle retries and status updates.

7. **Callback Engine**:
   - Invokes user-provided webhook or function on completion.

8. **Notification System**:
   - Sends status via email, Slack, etc.

9. **Monitoring & Metrics**:
   - Prometheus/Grafana setup.
   - Track lag, retries, success rates.

10. **Leader Election System**:
   - Zookeeper or Etcd ensures only one scheduler is active.

11. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Allows manual control: pause, resume, delete, re-trigger tasks.

### ✅ 6. Database Design

**Task Table:**
- task_id (PK)
- cron_expression
- retry_policy
- callback_url
- status
- payload
- created_at / updated_at

**History Table:**
- task_id (FK)
- status (success/failure)
- start_time / end_time
- log_url
- retry_count

---

### ✅ 7. Caching Strategy

- Redis to cache upcoming tasks (next 5 mins window)
- Cache recent task results for dashboard speed
- TTL eviction with pub-sub for dashboard refresh

---

### ✅ 8. API Design

- `POST /task`
- `GET /task/{id}`
- `POST /task/{id}/cancel`
- `POST /task/{id}/retry`
- JWT + Role-based access
- 429 rate limiting

---

### ✅ 9. Data Consistency

- Task creation and enqueue are atomic
- Use distributed locks to avoid duplicate executions
- Eventual consistency for logs and metrics is acceptable

---

### ✅ 10. Scalability

- Workers are autoscaled based on Kafka topic depth
- Horizontal scale of API and Scheduler
- Partition task queues by region/priority

---

### ✅ 11. Fault Tolerance

- Tasks are persisted before execution
- Failed nodes reassign tasks after timeout
- Heartbeats and leader fencing to avoid split-brain

---

### ✅ 12. Security

- HTTPS
- Encrypted task payloads
- Signed webhook callback payloads
- OAuth2/JWT for dashboard and APIs

---

### ✅ 13. Monitoring & Alerts

- Prometheus + Grafana: success rate, queue size, lag, retries
- Alerting: failed task spikes, execution latency
- Audit logs in ELK stack

---

### ✅ 14. Trade-Offs

- Kafka chosen for durability vs lighter in-memory queue
- Eventual consistency on dashboard for write throughput
- Partitioned queues reduce latency but add complexity

---

### ✅ 15. Future Enhancements

- ML-based anomaly detection on task failures
- Custom plugin runners (Docker, Airflow DAG, shell script)
- SLA-based execution classes
- Support for workflow orchestration

---

✅ Conclusion:
A robust, horizontally scalable distributed task scheduler built for reliability, latency guarantees, and extensibility. It supports high volume scheduled workloads with retries, hooks, and full observability.
