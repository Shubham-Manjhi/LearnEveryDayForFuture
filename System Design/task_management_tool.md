---

### ðŸ“… 1. Clarify the Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Users can create projects, boards, lists, and tasks.
2. Support for multiple users and teams with access control.
3. Tasks can have due dates, assignees, attachments, and comments.
4. Real-time updates for collaborative task management.
5. Drag-and-drop functionality for task prioritization.
6. Notifications for task assignment, due dates, and comments.

### âœ… 3. Component Deep Dive (100+ Words Each)

1. **Web/Mobile Clients**: Frontend applications allow users to interact with boards, create and move tasks, and get real-time updates. Built using React Native or Flutter, optimized for minimal latency and high interactivity.

2. **Load Balancer**: Ensures even distribution of requests across stateless API servers, and supports SSL termination and DDoS protection.

3. **API Gateway**: Handles routing, authentication checks, rate-limiting, and versioned APIs. Also integrates with webhooks for third-party automation.

4. **Auth Service**: Responsible for managing user identities, SSO/OAuth, session tokens, and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for projects and tasks.

5. **Project Service**: Manages the hierarchy of organizations, teams, projects, and boards. Ensures permissions are enforced and board metadata is returned efficiently.

6. **Task Service**: Core microservice responsible for CRUD operations on tasks, comments, checklists, and labels. Also supports attachments via object storage links.

7. **Notification Service**: Generates and dispatches task updates, reminders, and comments to users via email, SMS, or in-app alerts.

8. **Project DB (SQL)**: Stores relational data like user profiles, team memberships, project and board metadata. Supports ACID compliance and joins.

9. **Task DB (NoSQL)**: Optimized for flexible document storage (e.g., MongoDB), enabling quick retrieval of task hierarchies, lists, and nested subtasks.

10. **Redis + Messaging Engine**: Redis used for caching user sessions and real-time update queues. Integration with AWS SES or Twilio for external messaging.

11. **WebSocket Sync Server**: Enables low-latency, real-time collaboration with publish-subscribe model. Clients subscribe to project/task channels to receive live updates.

12. **Real-Time Event Queue**: (e.g., Kafka) decouples user actions from async processors like logging, metrics aggregation, and email dispatch.

13. **Monitoring & Logging**: Stack like Prometheus + Grafana + ELK monitors errors, latency, uptime, and task operation metrics.

### âœ… 5. Estimations

- 1M daily active users â†’ ~50M API calls/day
- Avg 10 tasks/user/day â†’ 10M task writes
- Avg Task record = 2KB â†’ 20GB/day task write volume
- Redis cache for 5M active sessions â†’ ~500MB RAM
- WebSocket connections peak = 250K concurrent

---

### âœ… 6. Caching Strategy

- Cache project/task metadata for faster board loads.
- Store active user sessions and permissions in Redis.
- Use write-through for high-priority tasks.

---

### âœ… 7. API Design

- `POST /project`
- `GET /project/{id}`
- `POST /task`
- `PATCH /task/{id}`
- `POST /task/{id}/comment`
- `GET /activity/{task_id}`

---

### âœ… 8. Fault Tolerance

- WebSocket auto-reconnect with backoff
- Retry queues for messaging/email failures
- Backup DB and event logs

---

### âœ… 9. Security

- OAuth 2.0 and RBAC
- HTTPS + JWT tokens
- Audit logging for all actions
- Encrypted file attachments

---

### âœ… 10. Monitoring & Alerts

- Alert on WebSocket disconnect rates
- Track latency of task updates
- Dashboard for project/task creation trends

---

### âœ… 11. Trade-offs

- SQL for projects vs NoSQL for tasks ensures performance + flexibility
- Real-time sync costs bandwidth but improves UX
- Microservices require more DevOps but offer better scalability

---

### âœ… 12. Future Improvements

- Integrate voice commands (e.g., via Alexa)
- Add AI-based task suggestion/reminders
- Plugin ecosystem for 3rd-party tools

ðŸ”„ Final Thoughts:
A collaborative task tool balances real-time user interaction, data flexibility, and team security. By combining SQL+NoSQL, async messaging, and strong access control, we achieve both responsiveness and scale.
