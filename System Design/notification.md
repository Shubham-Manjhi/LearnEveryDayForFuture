**System Design: Real-Time Notification System**

---

### ✅ 1. Clarify the Requirements

**Functional Clarifications:**

- The system should allow applications to send real-time notifications to users.
- Support **push**, **email**, **SMS**, and **in-app** notifications.
- Deliver notifications instantly or based on schedule.
- Ensure notification **de-duplication** and **idempotency**.
- Support **user preferences** (channels, quiet hours).
- Handle **bulk notifications** (e.g., 1M+ users).
- Track delivery status (sent, failed, opened).

**Non-Functional Clarifications:**

- Must be **highly available** and **fault-tolerant**.
- **Low latency** (<500ms) for real-time delivery.
- **Scalable** to support millions of users and messages.
- Support **multi-region** deployment.
- Ensure **eventual consistency** and high throughput.
- Secure user data and APIs.

### ✅ 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Notification Generation**: Accepts new messages from internal or external sources.
2. **Channel Routing**: Based on user preference, route to Email, SMS, Push, etc.
3. **Queue Management**: Buffer and retry messages via message queues.
4. **User Preferences**: Respect preferences, mute times, and do-not-disturb settings.
5. **Delivery Tracking**: Track message status (sent, delivered, opened).
6. **Scheduling**: Support delayed or scheduled sends.
7. **Bulk Delivery**: Efficient fan-out for high volume.

---

### ✅ 3. Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**: Elastic scaling using pub/sub and autoscaling workers.
2. **Availability**: Redundant channel handlers and failover queues.
3. **Latency**: <500ms for real-time in-app/push delivery.
4. **Security**: Authenticated APIs, encrypted storage, scoped tokens.
5. **Resilience**: Retry queues and circuit breakers on third-party API failure.
6. **Observability**: Dashboards, structured logs, and alerting.
7. **Regional Distribution**: Minimize latency using multi-region delivery nodes.

### ✅ 5. Component Deep Dive

1. **Notification API**: Entry point for producing new notifications. Authenticated with OAuth2. Rate-limited and batched for high-volume cases.

2. **Notification Core**: Decides the routing logic, reads metadata like priority, retries, etc. Handles deduplication.

3. **User Preferences Service**: Stores user's preferred channels, quiet hours, notification types. Cached in Redis.

4. **Auth Service**: Validates producer clients and enforces roles.

5. **Formatter**: Converts raw template + data into channel-specific messages (e.g., HTML for email, plain text for SMS).

6. **Message Queue**: Kafka or RabbitMQ buffers notifications before dispatch. Priority topics for urgent messages.

7. **Rate Limiter**: Ensures per-user or per-channel throttling. Avoids spamming or hitting provider limits.

8. **Channel Dispatcher**: Fan-out module that parallelizes delivery to multiple channels. Uses adapters for each provider.

9. **Channel Providers**: Handles actual transmission: SMTP for email, Firebase for push, Twilio for SMS, etc.

10. **Delivery Tracker**: Logs success/failure with time, provider ID, retry info. Used for auditing.

11. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager. Tracks latencies, failures, throughput.

### ✅ 6. Database Design

**Notifications Table:**

- notification\_id (PK)
- user\_id
- channel
- payload
- status (pending, sent, failed)
- created\_at, sent\_at

**User Preferences Table:**

- user\_id (PK)
- allowed\_channels (array)
- mute\_start, mute\_end
- blocked\_types (array)

---

### ✅ 7. Caching Strategy

- Redis for user preferences and throttling counters.
- In-memory LRU cache for frequently used templates.
- CDN for rich content delivery (images in HTML emails).

---

### ✅ 8. API Design

- `POST /notify`
- `GET /notify/status/{id}`
- `POST /notify/bulk`
- `GET /user/preferences/{userId}`
- JWT, client-scoped tokens

---

### ✅ 9. Data Consistency

- Producer-to-queue is atomic (ACK from Kafka).
- Tracker is eventually consistent.
- Duplicate suppression using UUID+timestamp key.

---

### ✅ 10. Scalability

- Horizontal scaling of queue consumers (dispatchers).
- Shard queues per region or channel.
- Auto-scale based on lag or pending message count.

---

### ✅ 11. Fault Tolerance

- Retry on provider errors (exponential backoff).
- DLQs (dead-letter queues) for failed events.
- Circuit breakers per provider to prevent overload.

---

### ✅ 12. Security

- HTTPS + OAuth2
- Encrypted payloads at rest and in transit
- RBAC for admin vs service clients
- IP allowlisting for webhook targets

---

### ✅ 13. Monitoring & Alerts

- Prometheus: per-channel latency, failure rate
- Alert on DLQ growth, spike in failure rate
- ELK for logs, tracing via OpenTelemetry

---

### ✅ 14. Trade-Offs

- Eventual consistency in status updates
- Prioritized async delivery over strict ordering
- CDN improves speed but can cause stale content

---

### ✅ 15. Future Enhancements

- ML-based channel selection (email vs push vs SMS)
- Priority-aware retry policies
- In-app read-receipt tracking
- Campaign analytics dashboard

---

✅ Conclusion: A secure, modular, and scalable real-time notification system built for multi-channel delivery, user-level personalization, and high observability. Fully supports modern product needs like alerts, campaigns, and transactional messages.
