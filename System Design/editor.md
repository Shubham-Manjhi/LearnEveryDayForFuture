### âœ… 3. Component Deep Dive

1. **Web/Mobile Clients**: Frontend interface where users type, format, and interact with docs. Changes are propagated via WebSockets or WebRTC.

2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes client traffic across app servers for availability and performance.

3. **API Gateway**: Authenticates and routes requests to internal services. Supports rate limiting and monitoring.

4. **Authentication Service**: Manages login, JWT token issuance, session management, SSO, and access roles.

5. **Collaboration Engine**: Handles operational transformation (OT) or CRDT-based syncing of user changes. Resolves conflicts and merges edits in real-time.

6. **Document DB**: Stores finalized document states, user metadata, access rules. (e.g., PostgreSQL, Spanner)

7. **Change Log DB**: Records fine-grained edit events for undo/redo and versioning. (e.g., Cassandra, DynamoDB)

8. **Presence Service**: Tracks which users are online, their cursors, and selections. Real-time with Redis or pub/sub systems.

9. **Versioning Engine**: Maintains document snapshots and enables restoring to previous states.

10. **Notification/Chat Service**: Enables user messaging, comment tagging, and alerts on edits.

11. **Monitoring & Logging**: Captures system health, latency, error tracking (Prometheus + Grafana).

### âœ… 4. Database Design (3 Key Entities)

#### Document Entity:
```json
{
  "doc_id": "abc123",
  "owner_id": "user456",
  "title": "Design Doc",
  "created_at": "2025-07-16T12:00:00Z",
  "last_modified": "2025-07-16T12:10:00Z",
  "permissions": [
    { "user_id": "user789", "role": "editor" }
  ]
}
```

#### ChangeLog Entity:
```json
{
  "change_id": "chg8910",
  "doc_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": "user456",
  "op": "insert",
  "content": "hello",
  "pos": 52,
  "timestamp": "2025-07-16T12:05:00Z"
}
```

#### Presence Entity:
```json
{
  "doc_id": "abc123",
  "user_id": "user456",
  "cursor_pos": 84,
  "status": "active",
  "last_ping": "2025-07-16T12:05:05Z"
}
```

### âœ… 5. Caching Strategy
- Use Redis to cache recent document states for fast recovery.
- Store user presence data in memory for fast reads.
- CDN for loading static document templates or images.

---

### âœ… 6. API Design (REST + WebSocket)
- `GET /document/{id}`
- `POST /document/{id}/edit`
- `GET /document/{id}/history`
- `WS /document/{id}/sync`  â†’ real-time collaboration

---

### âœ… 7. Real-Time Sync + Conflict Resolution
- Use **Operational Transformation (OT)** or **CRDT** for conflict resolution.
- Maintain a change buffer per document.
- OT engine serializes and transforms concurrent edits.

---

### âœ… 8. Estimations
- 1M daily active users, each editing for ~30 mins.
- Avg 2 edits/sec/user = 2M ops/sec peak.
- Each change ~100B â†’ 200 MB/sec write throughput.
- Store 1B documents, 10 versions = ~10 TB total.

---

### âœ… 9. Fault Tolerance
- Multi-zone deployments.
- Write-ahead log for change durability.
- Retry queues for failed operations.

---

### âœ… 10. Security
- OAuth2 for access.
- End-to-end TLS.
- Encryption-at-rest (AES-256).
- Secure change auditing for compliance.

---

### âœ… 11. Monitoring & Alerts
- Metrics on edit latency, failures, cursor drift.
- User engagement stats, abuse prevention.
- Alert on sync delay spikes.

---

### âœ… 12. Trade-offs
- OT is more complex than CRDT but well-tested.
- WebSocket preferred for real-time, falls back to polling on bad networks.
- Denormalized permissions for faster access vs. more storage.

---

### âœ… 13. Future Enhancements
- ML-powered autocomplete or suggestion engine.
- AI summarization of document history.
- Real-time voice-to-text editing.

ðŸ”„ Final Words:
A real-time, collaborative document system requires solving hard problems in concurrency, latency, and consistency. With a modular, scalable design and strong observability, the editor can deliver seamless experiences even under global load.
