**System Design: Voting or Polling System (e.g., Google Forms Poll, Twitter Poll)**

---

### ðŸ“… 1. Clarify the Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**

1. Users can create polls with multiple options.
2. Polls can be open (public) or private (invite-only).
3. Users can vote exactly once per poll.
4. Support for both single-choice and multi-choice polls.
5. Voting deadline (expiry) support.
6. Real-time vote tallying.
7. Results can be visible during or after the poll.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. Low-latency vote submissions (<100ms).
2. High availability during peak vote loads.
3. Horizontal scalability for viral polls.
4. Strong consistency to prevent double voting.
5. Secure data handling and authorization.
6. Auditable vote records.
7. Global performance (via CDNs or edge cache).

### âœ… 3. Component Deep Dive

1. **Web/Mobile Clients**: Allow users to create polls, vote, and view results. Input validation and UI feedback are crucial.

2. **Load Balancer**: Routes client requests across the backend servers evenly to ensure high availability.

3. **API Gateway**: Secures and proxies requests to various backend services, enabling rate limiting and observability.

4. **Auth Service**: Handles user login (OAuth, JWT) and ensures one vote per user/IP/device depending on poll rules.

5. **Voting Service**: Manages poll lifecycle, vote validation, vote deduplication, and scheduling of poll deadlines.

6. **Poll Metadata DB**: Stores poll structure, options, timestamps, visibility settings. Typically a SQL store.

7. **Vote Store (NoSQL)**: Scalable and fast NoSQL database (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra) for storing high-throughput votes.

8. **Cache (Redis/Memcached)**: Maintains current vote counts for hot polls in memory for fast tally.

9. **Analytics Service**: Tracks vote patterns, IPs, geolocation metrics, and detects anomalies or fraud.

10. **Result Engine**: Periodically aggregates and stores vote results, including for ended polls.

11. **Notification Service**: Sends poll status, updates, or result notifications to users.

### âœ… 4. Database Design (3 Key Entities)

#### Poll Entity:

```json
{
  "poll_id": "poll789",
  "creator_id": "user123",
  "question": "Which feature do you want next?",
  "options": ["Dark Mode", "Offline Access", "Better UI"],
  "expires_at": "2025-07-18T12:00:00Z",
  "visibility": "public",
  "type": "single-choice"
}
```

#### Vote Entity:

```json
{
  "vote_id": "vote123",
  "poll_id": "poll789",
  "user_id": "user456",
  "choice": "Dark Mode",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-16T13:00:00Z"
}
```

#### Result Entity:

```json
{
  "poll_id": "poll789",
  "result": {
    "Dark Mode": 823,
    "Offline Access": 502,
    "Better UI": 314
  },
  "last_updated": "2025-07-16T14:00:00Z"
}
```

### âœ… 5. Caching Strategy

- Redis for hot poll vote counts (real-time tally).
- Cache result aggregates for popular polls.
- Cache user session for fast authentication.

---

### âœ… 6. API Design (REST + Webhook)

- `POST /poll` â†’ create poll
- `GET /poll/{id}` â†’ fetch poll info
- `POST /poll/{id}/vote` â†’ cast vote
- `GET /poll/{id}/result` â†’ fetch live results
- `Webhook /poll/{id}/ended` â†’ notify when expired

---

### âœ… 7. Real-Time Aggregation

- Use Redis INCR for fast vote count update.
- Background job syncs Redis to DB.
- Result Engine handles percentile & stats.

---

### âœ… 8. Estimations

- 5M active polls/day, avg 1K votes â†’ 5B votes/day.
- Avg 100B per vote â†’ 500 GB/day ingestion.
- Peak: 100K votes/sec â†’ NoSQL, Redis scale-out.
- Poll metadata: \~1 KB â†’ \~5 GB/day for metadata.

---

### âœ… 9. Fault Tolerance

- Write-ahead log for vote ingestion.
- Retry queue for failed submissions.
- Poll metadata backup every hour.

---

### âœ… 10. Security

- JWT + RBAC for access control.
- Rate limiting per IP/user.
- HTTPS + encryption at rest.
- Anomaly detection for bot/fraud votes.

---

### âœ… 11. Monitoring & Alerts

- Track vote throughput, latency, failure rate.
- Alert on voting fraud or abuse.
- Dashboard for poll health & queue depth.

---

### âœ… 12. Trade-offs

- Denormalized vote counts for read speed, but adds sync cost.
- Eventual consistency for tally, strong consistency on submission.
- Real-time system adds infra complexity.

---

### âœ… 13. Future Enhancements

- ML to flag suspicious votes.
- Poll logic with conditional branching.
- Support for media-based polls (images/videos).

---

ðŸ”„ Final Words: Designing a highly available, real-time voting system requires careful balance between write-heavy operations and fast aggregation. With scalable architecture, fraud protection, and accurate results tracking, this system can handle everything from classroom polls to global elections.
