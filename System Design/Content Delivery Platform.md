### âœ… 3. Component Deep Dive (100+ words each)

1. **Client App**: Browser/mobile/TV apps fetch metadata and stream chunks using HLS/DASH. Also used for user interactions (likes, comments, playback).

2. **Load Balancer**: Distributes user requests to backend servers. Ensures traffic doesn't overload specific services.

3. **API Gateway**: Entry point for client requests. Applies rate limiting, logging, authentication, and routes to microservices.

4. **Auth Service**: Verifies users with JWT/OAuth2. Also enforces content restrictions based on age, geo, or subscription level.

5. **Metadata Service**: Stores and retrieves video titles, tags, owner info, duration, etc. Backed by a scalable NoSQL DB.

6. **Video Upload Service**: Handles multipart uploads from creators. Stores raw videos temporarily, triggers processing.

7. **Encoding Service**: Transcodes raw video into multiple resolutions and formats (H.264, VP9, AV1). Also applies watermarks or DRM if needed.

8. **Object Store (S3/Blob)**: Final videos stored in an immutable, distributed object store. Stores versions for ABR streaming.

9. **CDN**: Caches and serves videos closer to end-users, reducing latency and load on origin storage.

10. **Streaming Player**: Uses ABR logic to request suitable chunks based on user's bandwidth. Tracks metrics (buffer, resolution changes).

11. **Analytics Service**: Gathers watch time, engagement metrics, device/browser data. Used for optimization and reports.

12. **Ad Service**: Injects pre-roll/mid-roll ads. Supports targeting, frequency capping, and auction-based delivery.

13. **Recommendation Service**: ML-based engine that personalizes home/feed based on viewing patterns, history, and collaborative filtering.

### âœ… 4. Database Design (3 Key Entities)

#### Video Metadata Entity:

```json
{
  "video_id": "vid123",
  "uploader": "user456",
  "title": "Summer Highlights",
  "tags": ["travel", "vlog"],
  "duration": 325,
  "resolutions": ["240p", "480p", "720p", "1080p"]
}
```

#### User Entity:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user456",
  "email": "user@email.com",
  "subscription": "premium",
  "watch_history": ["vid123", "vid678"]
}
```

#### Playback Stats Entity:

```json
{
  "video_id": "vid123",
  "user_id": "user456",
  "watched_at": "2025-07-16T10:30:00Z",
  "play_duration": 285,
  "buffer_count": 3
}
```

### âœ… 5. Estimations

- 1B daily plays, avg video 5 mins = 5B mins/day â†’ 8.3M hours â†’ \~950TB/day at 2.5Mbps
- Uploads: 1M/day @ 100MB each â†’ 100TB/day ingestion
- CDN offload ratio 95%, origin read load is 50TB/day

---

### âœ… 6. Fault Tolerance

- Retry on chunk delivery failure
- Redundant CDNs and region failover
- Video transcoding queue with retries and status flags

---

### âœ… 7. Security

- Video DRM + signed URL access
- OAuth2 + geo-fencing for content
- Rate-limiting, secure uploads

---

### âœ… 8. Monitoring & Alerts

- Alert on player buffer spike
- Encoding failures > 5% in last 5 mins
- CDN cache hit ratio drop

---

### âœ… 9. Trade-offs

- ABR streaming adds client complexity but saves bandwidth
- Nearline analytics for freshness vs. cost
- High CDN cost offset by improved QoE

---

### âœ… 10. Future Enhancements

- Smart encoding with ML for compression ratio
- P2P edge delivery for bandwidth savings
- Generative previews and automatic subtitles
