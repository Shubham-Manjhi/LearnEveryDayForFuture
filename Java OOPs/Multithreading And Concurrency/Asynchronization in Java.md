# âš¡ **Asynchronization in Java**

Asynchronization allows Java programs to **perform tasks without blocking the main thread**, improving responsiveness and performance in concurrent applications.

## ðŸŸ¢ **What is Asynchronization?**

- Asynchronous programming enables tasks to **run independently** of the main thread.
- Main thread continues execution while background tasks complete in parallel.

**Advantages:**

1. Improves application responsiveness
2. Utilizes CPU efficiently
3. Suitable for I/O intensive tasks

## ðŸŸ¡ **Future and CompletableFuture**

### Future:

Represents **a result that may not be available yet**. You can use `get()` to wait for completion.

#### âœ… Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class FutureDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
        Future<Integer> future = executor.submit(() -> {
            Thread.sleep(1000);
            return 50;
        });

        System.out.println("Doing other tasks...");
        Integer result = future.get();
        System.out.println("Future result: " + result);
        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

### CompletableFuture:

Introduced in Java 8 for **non-blocking asynchronous programming**.

#### âœ… Example:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class CompletableFutureDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try { Thread.sleep(1000); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
            return 100;
        }).thenAccept(result -> System.out.println("Result: " + result));

        System.out.println("Main thread continues...");
        try { Thread.sleep(1500); } catch (InterruptedException e) {}
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- `thenAccept()` executes a callback after completion.
- Supports chaining multiple asynchronous operations.

## ðŸ”µ **ExecutorService for Asynchronous Tasks**

ExecutorService manages thread pools and executes tasks asynchronously.

### âœ… Example:

```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(3);
for(int i=1;i<=5;i++) {
    int taskId = i;
    executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Running async task " + taskId + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
}
executor.shutdown();
```

**Key Points:**

- Handles asynchronous task execution efficiently.
- Reduces overhead of creating individual threads.

---

## ðŸŸ£ **Parallel Streams**

Java 8 provides **parallel streams** for asynchronous data processing.

### âœ… Example:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ParallelStreamDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> list = Arrays.asList(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10);
        int sum = list.parallelStream().mapToInt(i -> i*2).sum();
        System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- Splits data into multiple threads automatically.
- Improves performance for CPU-bound tasks.

---

## ðŸŸ  **Async APIs in Java 8+**

- `CompletableFuture.runAsync()` for tasks without return values.
- `CompletableFuture.supplyAsync()` for tasks with return values.
- Supports **exception handling, timeouts, and combination** of multiple futures.

### âœ… Example:

```java
CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
    System.out.println("Async task running: " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
});
future.join();
```

---

## ðŸŸ¤ **Best Practices & Interview Tips**

1. Use `CompletableFuture` for non-blocking, chainable async tasks.
2. Prefer **ExecutorService** for controlled thread pool management.
3. Avoid blocking calls in asynchronous tasks.
4. Understand difference between **Future** and **CompletableFuture**.
5. Use parallel streams for CPU-bound operations where appropriate.

### âœ… Common Interview Questions:

- Difference between synchronous and asynchronous execution.
- How to implement asynchronous tasks in Java.
- Advantages of CompletableFuture over Future.
- How to chain multiple asynchronous tasks.
