## ðŸŸ¢ **Process Definition**

A **process** is an instance of a program that is executing in memory. It has its own:

- Memory space
- Data segment
- Stack
- Heap
- System resources

**Characteristics of a Process:**

1. Heavyweight in terms of resources
2. Independent execution
3. Inter-process communication (IPC) required to share data

### âœ… Example:

```java
// Using Runtime to execute another program (process)
try {
    Process process = Runtime.getRuntime().exec("notepad.exe");
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## ðŸŸ¡ **Thread Definition**

A **thread** is the smallest unit of execution within a process. Multiple threads within the same process share:

- Heap memory
- Global variables
- Resources

**Characteristics of a Thread:**

1. Lightweight compared to a process
2. Shares memory with other threads of the same process
3. Communicates easily with other threads

## ðŸ”µ **Differences Between Process and Thread**

| Feature       | Process                              | Thread                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Memory        | Separate memory space                | Shares memory space within process |
| Creation      | Heavyweight                          | Lightweight                        |
| Communication | IPC required                         | Direct memory sharing              |
| Overhead      | High                                 | Low                                |
| Crash impact  | Process crash does not affect others | Thread crash may affect process    |
| Example       | Running Notepad, Calculator          | Background tasks in Java app       |

## ðŸŸ£ **Multithreading within a Process**

- A single process can contain multiple threads running **concurrently**.
- Threads share resources, enabling **faster execution** and **lower memory usage** compared to multiple processes.

### âœ… Example:

```java
class Task extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is running");
    }
}

public class ProcessThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Task t1 = new Task();
        Task t2 = new Task();
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

- Both threads execute concurrently within the **same Java process**.

## ðŸŸ  **Best Practices & Interview Tips**

1. Use **threads** for tasks within the same application to save memory and improve performance.
2. Use **processes** for independent applications or services.
3. Understand **process vs thread scheduling** for performance tuning.
4. Be able to explain differences in **resource consumption, crash impact, and communication**.

### âœ… Common Interview Questions:

- Difference between process and thread in Java.
- Advantages of multithreading over multiple processes.
- How threads share memory and why it's more efficient.

Processes and threads are fundamental to Java concurrency. Understanding their differences helps design **efficient, scalable applications**.
